# Lesson: Introduction to Docker

## What is Docker?
Docker is an open-source platform that automates the deployment, scaling, and management of applications using container technology. Containers package an application and its dependencies into a single, portable unit.

## Why Use Containers?
- **Consistency:** Run the same app everywhere (dev, test, prod)
- **Isolation:** Each container runs independently
- **Efficiency:** Lightweight compared to virtual machines
- **Portability:** Works on any system with Docker installed

## Virtual Machines vs Containers
- **VMs:** Emulate entire operating systems, require more resources
- **Containers:** Share the host OS kernel, use fewer resources, start faster

| Feature         | Virtual Machine | Container         |
|----------------|----------------|------------------|
| Startup Time   | Minutes        | Seconds          |
| Resource Usage | High           | Low              |
| Isolation      | Strong         | Process-level    |
| Portability    | Limited        | High             |
