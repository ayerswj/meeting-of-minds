# Module 15: Capstone Project

## Project Overview
Design, deploy, and manage a production-grade application on Kubernetes, incorporating all concepts learned throughout the course.

---

## Objectives
- Architect a multi-service application (e.g., microservices or multi-tier)
- Implement networking (Ingress, Services), storage (PVCs), and configuration (ConfigMaps, Secrets)
- Use Helm for deployment
- Set up monitoring, logging, and alerting
- Apply security best practices (RBAC, Network Policies)
- Automate deployment with CI/CD
- Demonstrate scaling and high availability

---

## Suggested Steps
1. **Design**: Plan your application architecture and Kubernetes resources
2. **Setup**: Prepare your cluster and namespaces
3. **Deploy**: Use Deployments, StatefulSets, Services, and Ingress
4. **Configure**: Apply ConfigMaps, Secrets, and environment variables
5. **Secure**: Implement RBAC, Network Policies, and Secrets management
6. **Observe**: Set up Prometheus, Grafana, and EFK/ELK for observability
7. **Automate**: Use Helm and a CI/CD tool (e.g., ArgoCD) for deployment
8. **Scale**: Demonstrate autoscaling and high availability
9. **Document**: Write clear documentation and present your solution
