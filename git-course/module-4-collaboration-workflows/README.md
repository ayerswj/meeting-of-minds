## üìö Topics Covered

### 1. Team Collaboration Best Practices

#### Repository Organization

**Repository Structure:**
```
project/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .github/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ISSUE_TEMPLATE/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ workflows/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ docs/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ src/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ tests/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .gitignore
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ CONTRIBUTING.md
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md
```

**Essential Files:**
```markdown
# README.md
- Project description
- Installation instructions
- Usage examples
- Contributing guidelines
- License information

# CONTRIBUTING.md
- How to contribute
- Code style guidelines
- Testing requirements
- Pull request process

# CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md
- Community guidelines
- Expected behavior
- Reporting procedures
```

#### Branch Protection Rules

**GitHub Branch Protection:**
```yaml
# .github/branch-protection.yml
branches:
  - name: main
    protection:
      required_status_checks:
        strict: true
        contexts:
          - ci/tests
          - ci/lint
      enforce_admins: true
      required_pull_request_reviews:
        required_approving_review_count: 2
        dismiss_stale_reviews: true
        require_code_owner_reviews: true
      restrictions:
        users: []
        teams: []
```

**Local Branch Protection:**
```bash
# Prevent direct commits to main
git config branch.main.mergeoptions --no-ff

# Set up pre-commit hooks
# (covered in Module 3)
```

### 2. Pull Requests and Code Reviews

#### Creating Effective Pull Requests

**Pull Request Template:**
```markdown
## Description
Brief description of changes

## Type of Change
- [ ] Bug fix
- [ ] New feature
- [ ] Breaking change
- [ ] Documentation update

## Testing
- [ ] Unit tests pass
- [ ] Integration tests pass
- [ ] Manual testing completed

## Checklist
- [ ] Code follows style guidelines
- [ ] Self-review completed
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] No breaking changes

## Screenshots (if applicable)
```

**Pull Request Workflow:**
```bash
# Create feature branch
git checkout -b feature/new-feature

# Make changes and commit
git add .
git commit -m "feat: add new feature"

# Push and create PR
git push -u origin feature/new-feature

# Create PR on GitHub with:
# - Clear title and description
# - Link to related issues
# - Request specific reviewers
# - Add appropriate labels
```

#### Code Review Best Practices

**For Reviewers:**
- Review code, not the person
- Be constructive and specific
- Focus on functionality and maintainability
- Check for security issues
- Verify tests and documentation

**For Authors:**
- Keep PRs small and focused
- Respond to feedback promptly
- Update PR based on review comments
- Test changes thoroughly
- Update documentation

**Review Checklist:**
```markdown
## Code Review Checklist

- [ ] Are edge cases handled?
- [ ] Are error conditions handled?

### Code Quality

- [ ] Are naming conventions followed?
- [ ] Is there appropriate documentation?

### Security

- [ ] Are there memory leaks?

### Testing
- [ ] Are tests included?
- [ ] Do tests cover edge cases?
- [ ] Are tests meaningful and maintainable?
```

### 3. Git Flow and GitHub Flow

#### Git Flow (Enterprise)

**Branch Strategy:**
```
main (production)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ develop (integration)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ feature/user-auth
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ feature/payment
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ release/v1.2.0
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ hotfix/security-patch
```

**Git Flow Commands:**
```bash
# Initialize Git Flow
git flow init

# Feature development
git flow feature start user-authentication
# ... make changes ...
git flow feature finish user-authentication

# Release preparation
git flow release start 1.2.0
# ... final adjustments ...
git flow release finish 1.2.0

# Hotfix
git flow hotfix start security-patch
# ... fix ...
git flow hotfix finish security-patch
```

#### GitHub Flow (Simplified)

**Principles:**
1. Branch from main
2. Make changes
3. Create pull request
4. Review and discuss
5. Merge to main
6. Deploy immediately

**Workflow:**
```bash
# Start feature
git checkout -b feature-name
git add .
git commit -m "feat: add new feature"
git push -u origin feature-name

# Create PR, review, merge
# Then deploy immediately
```

#### Trunk-Based Development

**Key Principles:**
- Single main branch
- Short-lived feature branches
- Continuous integration
- Small, frequent commits

**Workflow:**
```bash
# Always work from latest main
git checkout main
git pull origin main

# Create short-lived branch
git checkout -b feature/quick-fix
git add .
git commit -m "fix: resolve issue"
git push -u origin feature/quick-fix

# Create PR, review, merge quickly
```

### 4. Fork and Contribution Workflows

#### Forking Workflow

**Forking Process:**
```bash
# 1. Fork repository on GitHub
# 2. Clone your fork
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/project.git
cd project

# 3. Add upstream remote
git remote add upstream https://github.com/original/project.git

# 4. Create feature branch
git checkout -b feature/contribution
```

**Keeping Fork Updated:**
```bash
# Fetch upstream changes
git fetch upstream

# Merge upstream main into your main
git checkout main
git merge upstream/main

# Push to your fork
git push origin main
```

**Submitting Contributions:**
```bash
# Make changes in feature branch
git add .
git commit -m "feat: add new feature"
git push origin feature/contribution

# Create PR from your fork to upstream
# Wait for review and merge
```

#### Contributing to Open Source

**Before Contributing:**
1. Read the project's contributing guidelines
2. Check existing issues and PRs
3. Understand the project's coding standards
4. Set up development environment

**Contribution Process:**
```bash
# Fork and clone
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/project.git
cd project

# Create feature branch
git checkout -b fix/issue-description

# Make changes
# Write tests
# Update documentation

# Commit with conventional format
git commit -m "fix: resolve issue #123"

# Push and create PR
git push -u origin fix/issue-description
```

### 5. Team Management and Permissions

#### Repository Permissions

**GitHub Team Roles:**
- **Admin**: Full access to repository
- **Maintain**: Manage issues, PRs, and repository settings
- **Write**: Push code and manage issues/PRs
- **Read**: View and clone repository
- **Triage**: Manage issues and PRs without write access

**Setting Up Teams:**
```bash
# Create team on GitHub
# Add members to team
# Assign team to repository with appropriate role
```

#### Code Owners

**CODEOWNERS File:**
```bash
# .github/CODEOWNERS

# Global owners
* @project-admin

# Frontend files
*.js @frontend-team
*.css @frontend-team
*.html @frontend-team

# Backend files
*.py @backend-team
*.java @backend-team

# Documentation
docs/ @docs-team
*.md @docs-team

# Configuration
.github/ @devops-team
```

#### Issue and PR Templates

**Issue Template:**
```markdown
<!-- .github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report.md -->
---
name: Bug report
about: Create a report to help us improve
title: ''
labels: bug
assignees: ''

---

### 6. Continuous Integration and Deployment

#### GitHub Actions

**Basic CI Workflow:**
```yaml
# .github/workflows/ci.yml
name: CI

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main, develop ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v3
    
    - name: Setup Node.js
      uses: actions/setup-node@v3
      with:
        node-version: '18'
        
    - name: Install dependencies
      run: npm ci
      
    - name: Run tests
      run: npm test
      
    - name: Run linting
      run: npm run lint
```

**Advanced CI/CD:**
```yaml
# .github/workflows/deploy.yml
name: Deploy

on:
  push:
    tags:
      - 'v*'

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v3
    
    - name: Deploy to production
      run: |
        echo "Deploying version ${{ github.ref_name }}"
        # Add deployment commands here
```
