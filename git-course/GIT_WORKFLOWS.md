# Git Workflows Guide

A comprehensive guide to different Git workflows, branching strategies, and team collaboration patterns.

## üéØ Understanding Git Workflows

A Git workflow is a recipe or recommendation for how to use Git to accomplish work in a consistent and productive manner. Different workflows are suited for different team sizes, project types, and organizational needs.

## üåø Git Flow (Enterprise Workflow)

### Overview
Git Flow is a robust workflow designed for projects with scheduled releases. It's ideal for enterprise environments with strict release management.

### Branch Structure
```
main (production)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ develop (integration)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ feature/user-auth
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ feature/payment
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ release/v1.2.0
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ hotfix/security-patch
```

### Branch Types

#### Main Branch
- **Purpose**: Production-ready code
- **Naming**: `main` or `master`
- **Protection**: Direct commits forbidden
- **Lifecycle**: Only receives merges from `develop` and `hotfix`

#### Develop Branch
- **Purpose**: Integration branch for features
- **Naming**: `develop`
- **Protection**: Direct commits allowed for integration
- **Lifecycle**: Receives merges from `feature` branches

#### Feature Branches
- **Purpose**: Development of new features
- **Naming**: `feature/feature-name`
- **Source**: `develop`
- **Target**: `develop`
- **Lifecycle**: Created from `develop`, merged back to `develop`

#### Release Branches
- **Purpose**: Preparation for production release
- **Naming**: `release/version-number`
- **Source**: `develop`
- **Target**: `main` and `develop`
- **Lifecycle**: Created from `develop`, merged to both `main` and `develop`

#### Hotfix Branches
- **Purpose**: Critical production fixes
- **Naming**: `hotfix/issue-description`
- **Source**: `main`
- **Target**: `main` and `develop`
- **Lifecycle**: Created from `main`, merged to both `main` and `develop`

### Git Flow Commands

#### Initialization
```bash
# Initialize Git Flow
git flow init

# Configure branch names (optional)
git flow init -d
```

#### Feature Development
```bash
# Start feature
git flow feature start user-authentication

# Work on feature
# ... make changes ...
git add .
git commit -m "feat: add user authentication"

# Finish feature
git flow feature finish user-authentication
```

#### Release Management
```bash
# Start release
git flow release start 1.2.0

# Make release adjustments
# ... update version numbers, changelog, etc. ...
git add .
git commit -m "chore: prepare release v1.2.0"

# Finish release
git flow release finish 1.2.0
```

#### Hotfix Management
```bash
# Start hotfix
git flow hotfix start security-patch

# Fix the issue
# ... make critical fixes ...
git add .
git commit -m "fix: resolve security vulnerability"

# Finish hotfix
git flow hotfix finish security-patch
```

### Git Flow Workflow Example

```bash
# 1. Start new feature
git flow feature start user-login

# 2. Develop feature
echo "function login() { ... }" > auth.js
git add auth.js
git commit -m "feat: implement user login"

# 3. Finish feature
git flow feature finish user-login

# 4. Start release
git flow release start 1.0.0

# 5. Prepare release
echo "v1.0.0" > VERSION
git add VERSION
git commit -m "chore: bump version to 1.0.0"

# 6. Finish release
git flow release finish 1.0.0

# 7. Handle hotfix
git flow hotfix start critical-bug
# ... fix bug ...
git flow hotfix finish critical-bug
```

### Advantages
- Clear separation of concerns
- Stable production code
- Organized release management
- Support for emergency fixes

### Disadvantages
- Complex for small teams
- Overhead for simple projects
- Multiple long-lived branches
- Complex merge scenarios

## üöÄ GitHub Flow (Simplified Workflow)

### Overview
GitHub Flow is a lightweight, branch-based workflow that supports teams and projects that deploy regularly. It's ideal for continuous deployment environments.

### Branch Structure
```
main (production)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ feature/new-feature
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ feature/bug-fix
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ feature/improvement
```

### Principles
1. **Branch from main**: Create feature branches from main
2. **Make changes**: Work on your feature
3. **Create pull request**: Open PR for discussion
4. **Review and discuss**: Get feedback from team
5. **Merge to main**: Merge after approval
6. **Deploy immediately**: Deploy to production

### GitHub Flow Commands

#### Feature Development
```bash
# Create feature branch
git checkout -b feature/new-feature

# Make changes
# ... work on feature ...
git add .
git commit -m "feat: add new feature"

# Push and create PR
git push -u origin feature/new-feature
```

#### Code Review Process
```bash
# After PR approval, merge to main
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git merge feature/new-feature

# Deploy immediately
git push origin main
# ... trigger deployment ...

# Clean up
git branch -d feature/new-feature
```

### GitHub Flow Example

```bash
# 1. Start feature
git checkout -b feature/user-profile
git pull origin main

# 2. Develop feature
echo "function getUserProfile() { ... }" > profile.js
git add profile.js
git commit -m "feat: add user profile functionality"

# 3. Push and create PR
git push -u origin feature/user-profile

# 4. After review, merge
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git merge feature/user-profile
git push origin main

# 5. Deploy
# ... deployment script ...

# 6. Cleanup
git branch -d feature/user-profile
```

### Advantages
- Simple and straightforward
- Supports continuous deployment
- Quick feedback cycles
- Easy to understand

### Disadvantages
- Less structured than Git Flow
- May not suit complex release management
- Requires good testing practices
- Can become chaotic with large teams

## üå≥ Trunk-Based Development

### Overview
Trunk-Based Development is a source-control branching model where developers collaborate on code in a single branch called "trunk" (main/master). It's ideal for teams practicing continuous integration.

### Branch Structure
```
main (trunk)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ feature/quick-fix (short-lived)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ feature/small-feature (short-lived)
```

### Principles
- **Single main branch**: All development happens on main
- **Short-lived feature branches**: Branches exist for hours, not days
- **Continuous integration**: Code is integrated frequently
- **Small commits**: Frequent, small commits
- **Immediate integration**: Merge to main as soon as possible

### Trunk-Based Development Commands

#### Feature Development
```bash
# Create short-lived branch
git checkout -b feature/quick-fix

# Make small, focused changes
git add .
git commit -m "fix: resolve login issue"

# Push and create PR immediately
git push -u origin feature/quick-fix
```

#### Integration
```bash
# After quick review, merge to main
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git merge feature/quick-fix
git push origin main

# Clean up immediately
git branch -d feature/quick-fix
```

### Trunk-Based Development Example

```bash
# 1. Start from latest main
git checkout main
git pull origin main

# 2. Create short-lived branch
git checkout -b fix/button-styling

# 3. Make focused change
echo ".button { color: blue; }" >> styles.css
git add styles.css
git commit -m "fix: update button color"

# 4. Push and create PR
git push -u origin fix/button-styling

# 5. Quick review and merge
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git merge fix/button-styling
git push origin main

# 6. Cleanup
git branch -d fix/button-styling
```

### Advantages
- Simple branching model
- Encourages continuous integration
- Reduces merge conflicts
- Fast feedback cycles

### Disadvantages
- Requires excellent testing
- May not suit complex features
- Requires mature development practices
- Can be challenging for large teams

## üîÑ Forking Workflow

### Overview
The Forking Workflow is commonly used in open source projects. Each developer has their own public repository (fork) and contributes via pull requests.

### Repository Structure
```
Original Repository (upstream)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Developer A's Fork
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ feature-branch
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Developer B's Fork
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ feature-branch
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Developer C's Fork
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ feature-branch
```

### Forking Workflow Commands

#### Setup
```bash
# Fork repository on GitHub
# Clone your fork
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/project.git
cd project

# Add upstream remote
git remote add upstream https://github.com/original/project.git
```

#### Development
```bash
# Create feature branch
git checkout -b feature/contribution

# Make changes
# ... work on feature ...
git add .
git commit -m "feat: add new feature"

# Push to your fork
git push -u origin feature/contribution
```

#### Keeping Fork Updated
```bash
# Fetch upstream changes
git fetch upstream

# Merge upstream main into your main
git checkout main
git merge upstream/main

# Push to your fork
git push origin main
```

#### Contributing
```bash
# Create PR from your fork to upstream
# Wait for review and merge
# Update your fork after merge
git checkout main
git pull upstream main
git push origin main
```

### Forking Workflow Example

```bash
# 1. Fork and clone
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/project.git
cd project
git remote add upstream https://github.com/original/project.git

# 2. Create feature branch
git checkout -b feature/documentation

# 3. Make changes
echo "# New Documentation" >> README.md
git add README.md
git commit -m "docs: add new documentation"

# 4. Push to fork
git push -u origin feature/documentation

# 5. Create PR on GitHub
# ... create PR from your fork to upstream ...

# 6. After merge, update fork
git checkout main
git pull upstream main
git push origin main
```

### Advantages
- Isolated development environment
- No direct access to original repository
- Suitable for open source contribution
- Clear contribution process

### Disadvantages
- More complex setup
- Requires manual synchronization
- May have outdated forks
- More steps for simple changes

## üè¢ Enterprise Workflows

### Centralized Workflow
A workflow where all developers work directly on the main branch. Suitable for small teams with simple projects.

```bash
# All work happens on main
git checkout main
git pull origin main

# Make changes directly
# ... work on feature ...
git add .
git commit -m "feat: add feature"

# Push directly
git push origin main
```

### Feature Branch Workflow
A workflow where all feature development takes place in dedicated branches. Suitable for teams that want to isolate work.

```bash
# Create feature branch
git checkout -b feature/new-feature

# Develop feature
# ... work on feature ...
git add .
git commit -m "feat: implement feature"

# Merge to main
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git merge feature/new-feature
git push origin main

# Clean up
git branch -d feature/new-feature
```

## üîß Workflow Configuration

### Branch Protection Rules

#### GitHub Branch Protection
```yaml
# .github/branch-protection.yml
branches:
  - name: main
    protection:
      required_status_checks:
        strict: true
        contexts:
          - ci/tests
          - ci/lint
      enforce_admins: true
      required_pull_request_reviews:
        required_approving_review_count: 2
        dismiss_stale_reviews: true
        require_code_owner_reviews: true
      restrictions:
        users: []
        teams: []
```

#### GitLab Branch Protection
