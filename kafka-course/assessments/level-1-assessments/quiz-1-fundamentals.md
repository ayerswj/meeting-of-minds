## True/False Questions (5 questions)

### Question 11
**Kafka guarantees exactly-once message delivery by default.**

**Answer**: F (False) - Kafka provides at-least-once delivery by default, not exactly-once.

### Question 12
**Messages within a partition are always ordered by their offset.**

**Answer**: T (True) - Messages within a partition are ordered by their sequential offset.

### Question 13
**A consumer group can have more consumers than partitions in a topic.**

**Answer**: T (True) - Extra consumers in a group will be idle but can take over if other consumers fail.

### Question 14
**Kafka topics are immutable once created.**

**Answer**: F (False) - Topic configurations can be modified, and partitions can be added.

### Question 15
**The console producer and consumer tools are only for testing purposes.**

**Answer**: T (True) - They are primarily used for testing and debugging, not production.

## Short Answer Questions (5 questions)

### Question 16
**Explain the concept of consumer groups in Kafka. How do they help with scalability?**

**Sample Answer**: Consumer groups allow multiple consumers to work together to process messages from a topic. Each partition is assigned to only one consumer within a group, enabling parallel processing. This allows the group to scale horizontally by adding more consumers, and provides fault tolerance if a consumer fails.

### Question 17
**What is the difference between 'earliest' and 'latest' in the auto.offset.reset configuration?**

**Sample Answer**: 
- 'earliest': Start consuming from the beginning of the topic (offset 0)
- 'latest': Start consuming only new messages that arrive after the consumer starts

### Question 18
**Describe the relationship between producers, topics, and consumers in Kafka.**

**Sample Answer**: Producers send messages to topics, which act as logical categories or feeds. Topics are divided into partitions for scalability. Consumers subscribe to topics and read messages from partitions. Multiple consumers can form a group to share the workload of processing messages from a topic.

### Question 19
**What is the purpose of the bootstrap.servers configuration in Kafka clients?**

**Sample Answer**: bootstrap.servers specifies the list of Kafka brokers that the client should connect to initially. The client uses these servers to discover the full cluster topology and then connects to the appropriate brokers for producing or consuming messages.

### Question 20
**Explain what happens during a consumer rebalancing event.**

**Sample Answer**: Consumer rebalancing occurs when consumers join or leave a consumer group. During rebalancing, partitions are redistributed among the remaining consumers to ensure fair workload distribution. The process is coordinated by the group coordinator and temporarily pauses message consumption.
