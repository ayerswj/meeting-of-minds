## 16. Advanced C# Features
### Lesson 1: Delegates, Events, and Lambdas
- **Description:** Master advanced function types and event-driven programming.
- **Key Points:**
  - Delegates and multicast delegates
  - Events and event handlers
  - Lambda expressions and closures
- **Example Code:**
  ```csharp
  public delegate int MathOp(int x, int y);
  MathOp add = (a, b) => a + b;
  Console.WriteLine(add(2, 3)); // 5

  public event EventHandler SomethingHappened;
  ```
- **Exercise:**
  - Create a delegate for string operations and use it with a lambda.
  - Implement a custom event and raise it from a class.

### Lesson 2: Reflection and Dynamic Programming
- **Description:** Inspect and manipulate types at runtime.
- **Key Points:**
  - Using `System.Reflection` to inspect assemblies
  - Creating objects dynamically
  - Invoking methods by name
- **Example Code:**
  ```csharp
  var type = typeof(string);
  foreach (var method in type.GetMethods())
      Console.WriteLine(method.Name);
  ```
- **Exercise:**
  - Write a method that prints all property names of any object using reflection.

### Lesson 3: Span<T> and Memory Management
- **Description:** Work with high-performance memory constructs.
- **Key Points:**
  - Using `Span<T>` and `Memory<T>` for efficient data access
  - Stack vs heap allocation
- **Example Code:**
  ```csharp
  Span<int> numbers = stackalloc int[5] { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 };
  numbers[0] = 10;
  ```
- **Exercise:**
  - Use `Span<T>` to reverse an array in-place.

## 17. Microservices with .NET
### Lesson 1: Designing Microservices
- **Description:** Architect distributed systems with microservices.
- **Key Points:**
  - Service boundaries and communication
  - Data consistency and eventual consistency
- **Exercise:**
  - Design a microservice architecture for an e-commerce system.

### Lesson 2: gRPC and RESTful Communication
- **Description:** Implement inter-service communication.
- **Key Points:**
  - Building gRPC services in .NET
  - RESTful APIs for microservices
- **Example Code:**
  ```csharp
  // gRPC service definition (proto file)
  service Greeter {
    rpc SayHello (HelloRequest) returns (HelloReply);
  }
  ```
- **Exercise:**
  - Create a simple gRPC service and client in .NET.

### Lesson 3: Service Discovery and Orchestration
- **Description:** Enable services to find each other and coordinate.
- **Key Points:**
  - Service registries (Consul, Eureka)
  - Orchestration with Kubernetes
- **Exercise:**
  - Deploy two .NET microservices and enable service discovery using Docker Compose or Kubernetes.

## 18. Performance Optimization
### Lesson 1: Profiling and Benchmarking
- **Description:** Measure and improve application performance.
- **Key Points:**
  - Using profilers (dotnet-trace, Visual Studio Profiler)
  - Benchmarking with BenchmarkDotNet
- **Example Code:**
  ```csharp
  [MemoryDiagnoser]
  public class Benchmarks
  {
      [Benchmark]
      public void TestMethod() { /* ... */ }
  }
  ```
- **Exercise:**
  - Benchmark two different sorting algorithms in C#.

### Lesson 2: Memory and CPU Optimization
- **Description:** Write efficient code for high-performance scenarios.
- **Key Points:**
  - Avoiding allocations
  - Using value types and spans
- **Exercise:**
  - Refactor a method to reduce memory allocations and measure the improvement.

## 19. Cross-Platform Development
### Lesson 1: .NET MAUI for Mobile/Desktop
- **Description:** Build cross-platform apps for mobile and desktop.
- **Key Points:**
  - Project structure in .NET MAUI
  - Shared UI and platform-specific code
- **Exercise:**
  - Create a simple .NET MAUI app that runs on Windows and Android.

### Lesson 2: Blazor for WebAssembly
- **Description:** Run .NET code in the browser with Blazor.
- **Key Points:**
  - Blazor WebAssembly vs Blazor Server
  - Component-based UI
- **Exercise:**
  - Build a Blazor WebAssembly app with a form and data binding.

## 20. Open Source Contribution and Community
### Lesson 1: Contributing to .NET Projects
- **Description:** Learn how to contribute to open source .NET projects.
- **Key Points:**
  - Forking, cloning, and submitting pull requests
  - Code of conduct and contribution guidelines
- **Exercise:**
  - Find a .NET open source project on GitHub and submit a documentation improvement PR.

### Lesson 2: Best Practices for Code Reviews and Collaboration
- **Description:** Collaborate effectively in teams and open source communities.
- **Key Points:**
  - Code review etiquette
  - Using issues and discussions
- **Exercise:**
  - Review a pull request and leave constructive feedback.
