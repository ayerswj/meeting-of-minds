# Lesson 4: Basic Syntax: Variables, Data Types, Operators

## Objectives
- Understand variables and data types in C#
- Use operators to perform calculations

## Explanation
### Variables
Variables store data in a program. In C#, you must declare a variable with a type.

```csharp
int age = 25;
string name = "Alice";
double height = 1.75;
bool isStudent = true;
```

### Data Types
- `int`: Integer numbers
- `double`: Floating-point numbers
- `string`: Text
- `bool`: Boolean (true/false)

### Operators
- Arithmetic: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`
- Assignment: `=`, `+=`, `-=`, etc.
- Comparison: `==`, `!=`, `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`
- Logical: `&&`, `||`, `!`

## Practice Exercises
1. Declare variables for your age, your name, and whether you like pizza. Print them to the console.
2. Write a program that calculates the sum, difference, product, and quotient of two numbers and prints the results.
