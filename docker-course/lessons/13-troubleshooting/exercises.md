# Exercises: Troubleshooting & Debugging Docker

1. **Diagnose a Broken Container:**
   - Start a container with a typo in the image name. What error do you see?

2. **View Logs:**
   - Run a container that exits immediately. Use `docker logs` to find out why.

3. **Debug with Shell:**
   - Use `docker exec` to get a shell in a running container and inspect its state.
