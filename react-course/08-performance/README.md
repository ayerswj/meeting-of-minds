# 08. Performance Optimization

## Learning Objectives
- Identify and fix performance bottlenecks in React apps
- Use memoization and virtualization
- Profile and optimize rendering

## Topics Covered

- Virtualization (react-window, react-virtualized)
- Profiling
- Avoiding Unnecessary Renders

## Recommended Resources
- [React Performance Docs](https://react.dev/learn/optimizing-performance)
- [react-window](https://react-window.vercel.app/)
- [React DevTools Profiler](https://react.dev/learn/debugging#profiling-performance)

## Practice
- Profile a React app and identify slow components
- Use React.memo and useCallback to optimize performance
- Implement list virtualization for large data sets
