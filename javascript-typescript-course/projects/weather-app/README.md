# Project: Weather App

## Objectives
- Build a weather app that fetches and displays data from a public API
- Practice working with APIs, async/await, and DOM manipulation

## Requirements
- Input for city name
- Fetch weather data from an API (e.g., OpenWeatherMap)
- Display temperature, conditions, and icon
- Handle errors (invalid city, network issues)

## Step-by-Step Instructions
1. **Setup**: Create `index.html`, `style.css`, and `weather.js`
2. **HTML**: Input for city, button, and display area
3. **JavaScript**:
   - Fetch data using `fetch` and async/await
   - Update the DOM with weather info
   - Handle errors gracefully
4. **Styling**: Make it visually appealing

## Extension Challenges
- Show 5-day forecast
- Use geolocation for current weather
- Use TypeScript for type safety
- Add loading animations
