# Module 1: Git Fundamentals

## üéØ Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:
- Understand what version control is and why it's important
- Explain Git's distributed nature and core philosophy
- Install and configure Git on your system
- Create your first Git repository
- Use basic Git commands to track changes
- Understand the three states of Git files

## üìö Topics Covered

### 1. Understanding Version Control

#### What is Version Control?
Version control is a system that records changes to a file or set of files over time so that you can recall specific versions later. Think of it as a "time machine" for your code.

**Why Version Control?**
- Track changes over time
- Collaborate with others
- Revert to previous versions
- Understand what changed and why
- Backup and recovery

#### Types of Version Control Systems

**Local Version Control**
- Simple database that keeps all changes to files under revision control
- Example: RCS (Revision Control System)

**Centralized Version Control (CVCS)**
- Single server contains all versioned files
- Clients check out files from central place
- Examples: Subversion, Perforce

**Distributed Version Control (DVCS)**
- Clients fully mirror the repository
- Every clone is a full backup
- Examples: Git, Mercurial, Bazaar

### 2. Git Philosophy and Design

#### Git's Core Principles
- **Distributed**: Every clone is a complete repository
- **Fast**: Most operations are local
- **Simple**: Simple design with powerful features
- **Branching**: Cheap and easy branching
- **Data Integrity**: SHA-1 hashing ensures data integrity

#### How Git Works
Git thinks of its data more like a series of snapshots of a miniature filesystem. Every time you commit, Git takes a picture of what all your files look like at that moment and stores a reference to that snapshot.

### 3. Git Installation and Configuration

#### Installing Git

**On Linux:**
```bash
# Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt-get install git

# CentOS/RHEL/Fedora
sudo yum install git
# or
sudo dnf install git

# Arch Linux
sudo pacman -S git
```

**On macOS:**
```bash
# Using Homebrew
brew install git

# Or download from https://git-scm.com/download/mac
```

**On Windows:**
Download from https://git-scm.com/download/win

#### Initial Configuration

After installation, configure your identity:
```bash
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"
```

**Other useful configurations:**
```bash
# Set default editor
git config --global core.editor "code --wait"  # VS Code
git config --global core.editor "vim"          # Vim
git config --global core.editor "nano"         # Nano

# Set default branch name
git config --global init.defaultBranch main

# Configure line ending handling
git config --global core.autocrlf input  # Linux/macOS
git config --global core.autocrlf true   # Windows

# View your configuration
git config --list
```

### 4. Your First Git Repository

#### Creating a Repository

**Initialize a new repository:**
```bash
mkdir my-first-project
cd my-first-project
git init
```

**Clone an existing repository:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/username/repository.git
git clone https://github.com/username/repository.git my-custom-name
```

#### Understanding the Repository Structure

After `git init`, you'll have:
- `.git/` directory (hidden) - contains all Git metadata
- Working directory - where you edit files
- Staging area (index) - where you prepare commits

### 5. Basic Git Commands

#### The Three States

Git has three main states that your files can reside in:
1. **Modified**: File has been changed but not staged
2. **Staged**: File has been marked to be included in next commit
3. **Committed**: File has been safely stored in local database

#### Essential Commands

**Check repository status:**
```bash
git status
```

**Add files to staging area:**
```bash
git add filename.txt          # Add specific file
git add .                     # Add all files
git add *.txt                 # Add all .txt files
git add src/                  # Add all files in src directory
```

**Commit changes:**
```bash
git commit -m "Initial commit"
git commit -m "Add user authentication feature"
```

**View commit history:**
```bash
git log
git log --oneline
git log --graph --oneline --all
```

**View differences:**
```bash
git diff                     # Show unstaged changes
git diff --staged           # Show staged changes
git diff HEAD~1             # Show changes in last commit
```

### 6. Understanding Git Objects

#### The Four Object Types

1. **Blob**: Stores file data
2. **Tree**: Stores directory structure and file names
3. **Commit**: Stores metadata about a commit
4. **Tag**: Stores a reference to a specific commit

#### How Commits Work

When you commit:
1. Git creates a blob for each file
2. Creates a tree representing the directory structure
3. Creates a commit object pointing to the tree
4. Updates the current branch to point to the new commit

## üõ†Ô∏è Hands-On Exercises

### Exercise 1: Setting Up Git
1. Install Git on your system
2. Configure your name and email
3. Set your preferred editor
4. Verify installation with `git --version`

### Exercise 2: Your First Repository
1. Create a new directory
2. Initialize a Git repository
3. Create a simple text file

   ```bash
   mkdir my-website
   cd my-website
   git init
   ```

2. **Create Basic Structure**
   - Create `index.html`
