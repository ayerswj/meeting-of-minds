# Introduction to Cloud Computing

## What is Cloud Computing?
Cloud computing is the on-demand delivery of IT resources over the Internet with pay-as-you-go pricing. Instead of buying, owning, and maintaining physical data centers and servers, you can access technology services, such as computing power, storage, and databases, on an as-needed basis from a cloud provider like AWS.

## Cloud Service Models
- **IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service):** Provides virtualized computing resources over the internet.
- **PaaS (Platform as a Service):** Offers hardware and software tools over the internet, typically for application development.
- **SaaS (Software as a Service):** Delivers software applications over the internet, on a subscription basis.
