# Module 14: Advanced Topics

## Learning Objectives
- Create and use Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs)
- Understand Operators and their use cases
- Manage multiple clusters
- Use Service Mesh (Istio, Linkerd)
- Automate with the Kubernetes API

---

## Lesson

### Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs)
- Extend Kubernetes with custom resources
- Used by Operators and advanced tools

### Operators
- Automate complex application management
- Example: Database operators

### Multi-Cluster Management
- Tools: Rancher, Cluster API, kubeadm
- Use cases: DR, geo-redundancy

### Service Mesh
- Istio, Linkerd for advanced networking, security, and observability
- Traffic management, mTLS, tracing

### Kubernetes API & Automation
- Use client libraries (Go, Python, etc.)
- Automate tasks and integrate with external systems

## Hands-On Lab: CRDs and Operators

1. Deploy a sample CRD (see official docs)
2. Install an Operator (e.g., Prometheus Operator)
3. Explore Service Mesh features with Istio or Linkerd

---

## Summary
Advanced Kubernetes features enable extensibility, automation, and management of complex, distributed systems.
