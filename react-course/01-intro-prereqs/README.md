# 01. Introduction & Prerequisites

## Overview
Welcome to the React Mastery Curriculum! Before diving into React, itâ€™s important to have a solid foundation in web development basics and set up your environment for success.

---

## What is React?
React is a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces, especially single-page applications (SPAs). It allows you to create reusable UI components and efficiently update the UI when your data changes.

**Key Features:**
- Component-based architecture
- Virtual DOM for fast updates
- Unidirectional data flow
- Rich ecosystem (React Native, Next.js, etc.)

**Why use React?**
- Large community and job market
- Reusable components = faster development
- Backed by Meta (Facebook)
- Powers many large-scale apps (Facebook, Instagram, Airbnb)

## Prerequisites
Before learning React, you should be comfortable with:
- **HTML:** Structure of web pages
- **CSS:** Styling web pages
- **JavaScript (ES6+):** Variables, functions, arrays, objects, arrow functions, destructuring, modules

**Quick Check:**
- Can you create a simple web page with HTML & CSS?
- Can you write a function in JavaScript and use `map`, `filter`, or `forEach` on an array?

**If not, review:**
- [MDN Web Docs - JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript)
- [freeCodeCamp - JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/)

## Setting Up Your Environment

### 1. Install Node.js and npm
React apps require Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager).
- Download and install from [Node.js Official Site](https://nodejs.org/)
- Verify installation:
  ```bash
  node -v
  npm -v
  ```

### 2. Choose a Code Editor
- [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is highly recommended.
- Install helpful extensions:
  - Prettier (code formatter)
  - ESLint (linter)
  - Reactjs code snippets

### 3. Install Browser Dev Tools
- Chrome: [React Developer Tools](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/react-developer-tools)
- Firefox: [React DevTools](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/react-devtools/)

### 4. Create a GitHub Account
- [Sign up for GitHub](https://github.com/)
- Learn basic git commands: `clone`, `commit`, `push`, `pull`

---

## Practice & Mini-Exercises
- Install Node.js and npm, then run `node -v` and `npm -v` in your terminal.
- Set up VSCode and install the recommended extensions.
- Create a GitHub account and clone a sample repository.
- Try writing a simple HTML page and a JavaScript function that prints numbers 1-5.

---

## Best Practices
- Keep your development environment up to date.
- Use version control (git) for all your projects.
- Practice keyboard shortcuts in your code editor.
- Join developer communities (Discord, Reddit, Stack Overflow).

---

## Glossary
- **Component:** Reusable piece of UI in React.
- **SPA:** Single Page Application, a web app that loads a single HTML page and updates dynamically.
- **npm:** Node Package Manager, used to install JavaScript libraries.
- **DevTools:** Browser tools for debugging and inspecting web apps.
