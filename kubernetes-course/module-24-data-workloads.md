# Module 24: Kubernetes for Data Workloads

## Learning Objectives
- Run data-intensive workloads on Kubernetes
- Use operators for databases and ML
- Understand storage and scheduling for data apps

---

## Lesson

### Data Workloads
- Databases, ML, analytics on Kubernetes
- StatefulSets and persistent storage

### Operators for Data
- Database operators (e.g., MongoDB, PostgreSQL)
- ML operators (e.g., Kubeflow)

### Scheduling Considerations
- Resource requests/limits
- Node affinity and taints

---

## Hands-On Lab: Deploying a Database
1. Deploy a database using an operator
2. Run a sample ML workload with Kubeflow
3. Explore storage and scaling

---

## Quiz
1. What is a StatefulSet?
2. Name an operator for ML on Kubernetes.
3. Why are node affinities important for data workloads?

## Case Study: ML Pipeline
A team wants to run an end-to-end ML pipeline on Kubernetes. Describe the setup, including operators, storage, and scaling.
